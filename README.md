A minimalistic and efficient application for OBS Studio, designed to capture your best gaming moments with a simple hotkey, without compromising performance.

## 🎯 Our Goal

The primary goal of OBS Replay Companion is to provide a **lightweight, fast, and stable solution for saving instant gameplay clips**. Unlike some built-in or third-party clipping tools, this application is optimized to minimize performance impact, ensuring a smooth experience for both streaming and recording.


## 🚀 Key Features

  * **Instant Clipping:** Save your last few minutes of gameplay with a single, customizable hotkey.
  * **Performance Optimized:** The application is built to be lean and efficient, with a minimal footprint on your CPU and GPU.
  * **Game-Specific Folders:** Clips are automatically organized into folders based on the game you're playing, making them easy to find.
  * **Simple & Intuitive UI:** A clean and straightforward user interface that integrates seamlessly with your OBS setup.


## 🛠️ How to Use and Setup

Follow these simple steps to get started with OBS Replay Companion.

### 1\. Download and Installation (Pre-built)

If you're a user who just wants to get started, this is the easiest way.

1.  **Download the latest pre-built package** from the [Releases](https://github.com/Chirraaa/OBSReplayCompanion/releases) page.
2.  **Extract all files** from the downloaded `.zip` and **copy them directly into your main OBS Studio installation folder**. The default location is `C:\Program Files\obs-studio`.
3.  **Navigate to `C:\Program Files\obs-studio\obs-plugins\64bit`** and **create a new folder** named `saved`.
4.  **Move the following two files** into this new `saved` folder:
      * `frontend-tools.dll`
      * `frontend-tools.pdb`

### 2\. Building from Source

For developers or those who want to compile their own version of the application, follow these steps.

1.  **Follow the official OBS Studio build guide for Windows** to set up your environment and dependencies. You can find the guide here: [Build Instructions for Windows](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/wiki/build-instructions-for-windows).

2.  After you've set up the build environment and cloned the main OBS repository, move your OBS build inside the `external` folder** of the OBS Studio source tree. Your file structure should look like this:

```code
OBSReplayCompanion/
├── build/
├── external/
│   ├── glfw/
│   ├── obs-studio/ <-- Your OBS build goes here
├── src/
│   ├── AudioDeviceFetcher.cpp
│   ├── MainWindow.h
│   └── ... (your project files)
├── ...
```


3.  Follow the rest of the OBS build guide to compile the OBS Studio project.

4.  Once the build is complete, you can find the necessary files in the `build/rundir/` directory. Proceed with building the obs replay companion files and you'll be all set by finding your built files at `OBSReplayCompanion/build/debug`.


## ⚙️ Behind the Scenes: Optimizations

This application is built with a focus on performance and reliability. Here are some of the key optimizations that make it so efficient:

  * **Asynchronous Clipping:** When you press the hotkey, the clipping process happens in the background. It doesn't block the main OBS thread, preventing any potential stutters or frame drops.
  * **Direct Buffer Access:** Instead of using complex video recording pipelines, the app directly accesses the OBS buffer to save clips, which is incredibly fast and efficient.
  * **Minimal Overhead:** The code is written in C++ and uses OBS's core APIs directly, ensuring that the application only uses the resources it absolutely needs.
